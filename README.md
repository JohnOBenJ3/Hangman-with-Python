# Hangman-with-Python
Terminal game "Hangman" written in Python

To play the game, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. This is written in version 3.7.5. 
If you are on a Windows machine, the clear() function will need to have the word "clear" replaced with "cls" for the function
to perform as expected.

## Playing the Game

Make sure you are in the correct directory.
Go to the terminal and type python3 hangman.py.
The number of allowed guesses is based on the idea of drawing a stick figure ie: head, arm, arm, body, leg, leg = 6 tries.
There are 500 possible words and vary in length.
Have fun!
